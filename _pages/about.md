Welcome to my website! 

I am a PhD student in the [Social Sciences Department](https://www.uc3m.es/social-sciences-department/home) at the UC3M under the supervision of [Pedro Riera](https://pedro-riera.com/). During the Spring of 2024, I was a visiting researcher at the [EUI](https://www.eui.eu/en/home). I am also part of the POLGEO research group led by Pedro Riera (PI).

My research interests are in political behavior and comparative politics, with a strong focus on quantitative methods. My PhD research examines the dynamic interplay between context and socialization processes. Specifically, I explore how political, social, and economic contexts shape individual and collective behaviors. Across my work, I investigate diverse phenomena, such as how touristification affects community cohesion and political participation, how unexpected electoral outcomes reshape identity formation and social norms, and how exposure to bad government mandates during formative years influences the formation of long-term partisan identification.

Before starting my PhD, I earned an MS in Economics from the Universitat de Barcelona and a BS in Economics from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.
