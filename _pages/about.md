Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD candidate in the [Social Sciences Department](https://www.uc3m.es/social-sciences-department/home) at the UC3M under the supervision of [Pedro Riera](https://pedro-riera.com/). During the Spring of 2024, I was a visiting researcher at the [EUI](https://www.eui.eu/en/home). I am also part of the HOMES research group funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and led by Pedro Riera (PI).

My research focuses on ehavior and political socialization, with a strong focus on quantitative methods. In my PhD research, I study how context dynamically shapes socialization, with particular attention to how changing social environments influence political behavior. One part of my work examines how highly mobile contexts, such as tourist destinations, weaken local participation by disrupting stable social interactions. A second project looks at intergenerational identity transmission, showing how families adjust their socialization efforts in response to local political environments. A third paper studies political learning, showing that individuals exposed to poor government performance when they first vote develop persistent anti-incumbent political identities. Beyond my dissertation, I am involved in different collaborative projects.

Before starting my PhD, I earned an MS in Economics from the Universitat de Barcelona and a BS in Economics from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.
