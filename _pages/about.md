Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD student in the [Social Sciences Department](https://www.uc3m.es/social-sciences-department/home) at the UC3M under the supervision of [Pedro Riera](https://pedro-riera.com/). During the Spring of 2024, I was a visiting researcher at the [EUI](https://www.eui.eu/en/home). I am also part of the POLGEO research group led by Pedro Riera (PI).

My research interests are in political behavior and comparative politics, with a strong focus on quantitative methods. My PhD research explores how political behavior and identities are shaped by the contexts in which people live. I examine three distinct but connected dynamics. First, I show how touristification and high mobility erode local civic participation by crowding out traditional spaces of interaction. Second, I demonstrate that elections held under poor government performance leave a lasting anti-incumbent imprint on first-time voters. Third, I analyze how electoral outcomes act as public signals of community preferences, reshaping private behavior through family cultural transmission. 

Before starting my PhD, I earned an MS in Economics from the Universitat de Barcelona and a BS in Economics from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.
