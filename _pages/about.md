Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD candidate in the [Social Sciences Department](https://www.uc3m.es/social-sciences-department/home) at the UC3M under the supervision of [Pedro Riera](https://pedro-riera.com/). During the Spring of 2024, I was a visiting researcher at the [EUI](https://www.eui.eu/en/home). I am also part of the HOMES research group funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and led by Pedro Riera (PI).

My research focuses on political behavior and socialization, with a strong focus on quantitative methods. In my PhD research, I study how contextual change shapes socialization and political behavior. Beyond my dissertation, I am involved in different collaborative projects. At UC3M, I co-founded the [PAPERSS Seminar Series](https://sites.google.com/view/paperss-seminarseries/home).

Before starting my PhD, I earned an MS in Economics from the Universitat de Barcelona and a BS in Economics from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.
