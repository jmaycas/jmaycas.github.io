  abstract: "Why does civic participation decline even in socially vibrant places? 
        This paper addresses an often-overlooked paradox: the way in which processes of social revitalization can undermine local civic life. While revitalization can promote civic engagement by increasing information flows and community visibility, it can also weaken participation by disrupting the social norms that sustain it. Drawing on a quasi-natural experiment, the transformation of the Way of Saint James (Camino de Santiago) into a major tourist route, I examine how both the arrival of newcomers and the social congestion affects community participation. I find a decline in civic engagement: association density drops by 16\% of the sample mean, and local turnout decreases by nearly two percentage points. Two mechanisms appear to drive this decline: (a) congestion, hostels tend to crowd urban centers, the main social hubs where human interactions occur, and (b) compositional changes, which bring a younger, mobile population with fewer participation incentives. Additional evidence from housing and demographic data reinforces this interpretation. Importantly, the weakening of civic norms seems to affect not only newcomers but also long-term residents."

  abstract: "More than two million evictions occur in the US annually, with profound and lasting consequences for the families and communities affected. This paper examines how the closure of brick-and-mortar bank branches in the US affected the number of households threatened with evictions from 2000-2018. To overcome the potential endogeneity associated with branch closures, we adopt an instrumental variable (IV) identification strategy that uses bank mergers as an instrument of the distance between the population and bank branches at the census tract level. Our results show that interstate and intercounty mergers positively and significantly affected the distance to the closest bank branches. Moreover, we find that a 1% increase in the distance to the closest branch generated a 2.3% increase in the number of households threatened with eviction. The effects in urban tracts primarily drive this result. We complement our analysis with several robustness checks, including a matching procedure to control for pre-existing observable differences between tracts exposed and unexposed to mergers. Moreover, we re-estimate our model focusing on mergers where the acquiring and the acquired banks had overlapping branches within the same tract, and we consider different measures of financial exclusion and exposition to evictions."
